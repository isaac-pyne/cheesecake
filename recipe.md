step one: preheat oven to 350 F ground your graham crackers (make sure there finely grounded) then mix your crumbs with melted butter, granulated sugar, and a little kosher salt
step two: press the crumbs into the botom of your pan (circles work best)
step three: mix cream cheese and suger until smooth and sour cream and vanila add eggs one at a time
step four:spread filling over crust
step five: place the pan into a larger pan and pour very hot water into the pan, until it’s 3/4- inch deep, careful to make sure the water level doesn’t come up higher than the foil. 
Bake for 60-70 minutes or until the center is almost set. The center will still jiggle while the edges will be set.
step six: Carefully run a knife around the rim of pan to loosen cake. Allow the cheesecake to cool at room temperature for at least an hour, then cover and transfer into the refrigerator for 6 hours or overnight.
